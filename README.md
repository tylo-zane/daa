Anxiety is a common problem. Over 19.1 percent of adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. When improperly designed for, this audience can be easily deterred from following through with a service or product [(Leber, 2020)](https://level-level.com/blog/inclusive-design-designing-for-people-with-anxiety/). Design Against Anxiety is a tool for user interface designers to help mitigate the anxiety experienced by their users.

DAA is divided into four design categories of focus: 
1. ### Flow  
How to properly guide the user's eyes as they navigate your interface
2. ### Forms 
Principles for creating non-intimidating user inputs
3. ### Account Creation
Principles for non-intrusive account creation services
4. ### Support 
Ensuring that the anxious user gets the support they need

By gradually working through this guide and ensuring that every mark gets checked off, interface designers can better provide a comfortable experience for their users with anxiety.
