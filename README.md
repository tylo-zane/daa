Anxiety is a common problem. Over 19.1 percent of adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. When improperly designed for, this audience can be easily deterred from following through with a service or product [(Leber, 2020)](https://level-level.com/blog/inclusive-design-designing-for-people-with-anxiety/). Design Against Anxiety is a tool for user interface designers to help mitigate the anxiety experienced by their users.
